Article 5 Legal entities or natural persons that are the owners, lessees or other users of agricultural land (hereinafter: owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land) must allow other persons to carry out, in accordance with regulations, beekeeping, hunting and the recreational gathering of fruits of wild plants, herbaceous wild plants, mushrooms and wild animals on non-arable agricultural land owned or leased by them or otherwise allotted to them and allow other persons free access to non-arable agricultural land provided that no damage is caused by doing so. Persons responsible for damage to land or crops shall be liable for compensation for damage to the owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land or crops in accordance with regulations. Article 6 The provisions of this Act with regard to the use and cultivation of agricultural land shall also apply to land that is designated as construction land or non-agricultural land in a spatial planning document until a building permit or another relevant act is issued for such land in accordance with regulations. Article 7 An owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land referred to in paragraph three of Article 2 of this Act must: -         cultivate agricultural land with due diligence; -         prevent the natural succession of vegetation on agricultural land, except on agricultural land that, in accordance with the regulation governing the records of actual land use, meets the conditions for land use classified as \"trees and shrubs\";',\n",
              " '-         use farming methods appropriate for the land and location in order to prevent soil compaction, erosion and pollution and to ensure the permanent fertility of land. For more efficient implementation of indent one of the preceding paragraph, notwithstanding the provisions of the Law of Property Code, the following shall be sufficient for the determination of agricultural land user and land use practices: -         the consent of co-owners whose undivided interest represents more than half of the surface area of the land, if agricultural land is co-owned, -         the consent of more than half of the owners if agricultural land is co-owned. If the agricultural inspection authority establishes that an owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land fails to act in accordance with indent one of paragraph one of this Article, it shall impose the implementation of appropriate measures by a decision. An owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land must carry out such measures within the time limits set by the decision, which, however, may not exceed a period of one year. If the agricultural inspection authority establishes that an owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land fails to act in accordance with indent two of paragraph one of this Article, it shall impose the implementation of appropriate measures by a decision. An owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land must carry out such measures no later than within a year of being served the decision; otherwise, the necessary measures shall be carried out at the expense of the owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land in an executive procedure. If the implementation of the measures referred to in indent two of paragraph one of this Article cannot be imposed upon the owner of agricultural land because his or her residence is unknown and he or she has no legal representative, such land shall be transferred to the Fund for temporary management.',\n",
              " 'An agricultural inspector shall notify an administrative unit of the owner of agricultural land with an unknown residence and without a legal representative and carry out the procedure for the transfer of such land to the Fund for temporary management. An administrative unit shall submit a proposal to a social work centre that a trustee be appointed for this specific case, who shall participate in the procedure for the transfer of such land to the Fund for temporary management. The right to the temporary management of agricultural land shall ex officio be entered in the land register on the basis of the final decision of an administrative unit. An owner may submit an application to an administrative unit for the cessation of temporary management. Temporary management shall cease upon the decision on the cessation of temporary management becoming final. If such agricultural land has been leased out and the owner and lessee do not agree otherwise, the lease shall cease three years after the decision on the cessation of temporary management becomes final, while the lessee shall have the right to cultivate the land until the crops have been harvested, but no later than until the end of the calendar year. In cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, the owner of agricultural land shall be obliged to refund to the Fund or possible lessee all expenses and investments related to the land; if the land was leased out, the owner shall be entitled to half of the rent over the lease period during temporary management. The Government shall determine detailed criteria for assessing whether an owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land has acted with due diligence. Persons who are not owners, lessees or other users of agricultural land shall use agricultural land on their own responsibility.']"

        "1. ***Preprocessing:***\n",
        "\n",
        "- Text Cleaning: Remove noise, formatting, and irrelevant information from the input texts.\n",
        "- Entity Extraction: Identify and extract relevant entities or keywords from both queries and contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ***Semantic Matching:***\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use a dedicated semantic matching model (BERT, RoBERTa) to perform similarity checks between the query and context embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ***Result Fusion:***\n",
        "\n",
        "- Combine outputs from different models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002, BERT) to create a diverse set of matched contexts.\n",
        "- Implement a fusion mechanism to aggregate results from multiple models and prioritize relevant contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. ***Answer Generation:***\n",
        "\n",
        "- Utilize a diverse set of language models (e.g., GPT-3, T5) to generate answers based on the fused contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. ***Feedback Mechanism:***\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implement a feedback loop to refine the system based on user interactions or feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "This alternative approach aims to leverage preprocessing for better data refinement, diverse model integration for improved matching, and fusion techniques to enhance the quality of generated answers."
